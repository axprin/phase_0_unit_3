####I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].



### My Quiz Results:

### Reflection
I thought this challenge was a mostly good introduction to SQL, but my real issue here is not with the content or teaching style, but just the fact that this SQLzoo website is horribly constructed and the quizzes don't really work. I think if DBC wants to maintain SQL as a part of phase 0, it would be beneficial to them to either find a new resource (I have been exposed to serveral) or build a new one themselves and incorporate it into socrates or something.
