## Release 5: Reflection
I think this challenge was crucial in the understanding and differentiation of the different types of relationships in the relational database world. These relationships are key (pun very much intended) to manipulating and querying for different sets of data within a database. It was fun to think about relationships in life and assign a relationship type to them.
